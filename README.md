# Portfolio powered by Gatsby.js & DatoCMS

Live @ https://alexandermenzel.dk

I decided it was time to renew my old portfolio. So I tried using gatsby.js and datoCMS for the first time, which I think turned out great. However, there was some learning to do in order to get it done.

It was totally worth it, now I have a site that I can update from DatoCMS which triggers a build on Netlify and within minutes the changes are live on the site.
